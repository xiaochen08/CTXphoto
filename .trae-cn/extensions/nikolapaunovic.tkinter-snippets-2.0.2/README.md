# Usage

To use these snippets simply type a snippet into your editor and press tab. There will be fields you have to fill out, such as position, text etc. To fill this info out simply start typing. Once you fill in a field press tab to move on to the next field.


# Snippet types

## Regular snippets

Regular snippets create elements with their most used parameters.

### Example:

![](https://github.com/lunaluvgood/tkinter-snippets/raw/master/images/flcexample.png)

## No variable snippets

prefix: **nv** 

Putting nv before the regular snippet creates an element without assigning it to a variable. These are not always recommended, however they are useful sometimes.

### Example:

![](https://github.com/lunaluvgood/tkinter-snippets/raw/master/images/nvflcexample.png)

## Basic snippets

prefix: **b**

Putting b before the regular snippet creates an element with only the prompt for a variable name and window selection.

### Example:

![](https://github.com/lunaluvgood/tkinter-snippets/raw/master/images/bfbcexample.png)


## X snippets

prefix: **x**

Putting x before the regular snippet or the nv snippet creates an element with only the prompt for setting the window and the grid positioning. X snippets are not available for all elements.

### Example:

![](https://github.com/lunaluvgood/tkinter-snippets/raw/master/images/xsnippetexample.png)

## No command snippets

prefix: **nc**

Putting nc befoe a regular or a nv snippet creates an element without a command parameter. This prefix can only be used for some elements (example: buttons).

### Example:

# List of snippets

## Note on snippet variety

As of update 2.0.0, all snippets have another form where you add the at- prefix. This pefix assumes you have used "import tkinter as tk" rather than "from tkinter import *" and adds tk. before every call to the tkinter module.
