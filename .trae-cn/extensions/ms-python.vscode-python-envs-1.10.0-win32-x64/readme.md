# Python Environments (preview)
> **Note:** The Python Environments icon may no longer appear in the Activity Bar due to the ongoing rollout of the Python Environments extension. To restore the extension, add `"python.useEnvironmentsExtension": true` to your User settings. This setting is temporarily necessary until the rollout is complete! 

## Overview

The Python Environments extension for VS Code helps you manage Python environments and packages using your preferred environment manager, backed by its extensible APIs. This extension provides unique support for specifying environments for specific files, entire Python folders, or projects, including multi-root and mono-repo scenarios. The core feature set includes:

-   🌐 Create, delete, and manage environments
-   📦 Install and uninstall packages within the selected environment
-   ✅ Create activated terminals
-   🖌️ Add and create new Python projects

> **Note:** This extension is in preview, and its APIs and features are subject to change as the project evolves.

> **Important:** This extension requires version `2024.23`, or later, of the Python extension (`ms-python.python`).

## Features

The "Python Projects" fold shows you all of the projects that are currently in your workspace and their selected environments. From this view you can add more files or folders as projects, select a new environment for your project, and manage your selected environments.

The "Environment Managers" fold shows you all of the environment managers that are available on your machine with all related environments nested below. From this view, you can create new environments, delete old environments, and manage packages.

To simplify the environment creation process, you can use "Quick Create" to automatically create a new virtual environment using:

-   Your default environment manager (e.g., `venv`)
-   The latest Python version
-   Workspace dependencies

For more control, you can create a custom environment where you can specify Python version, environment name, packages to be installed, and more!

The following environment managers are supported out of the box:

| Id                      | Name                    | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ms-python.python:venv   | `venv`                  | Built-in environment manager provided by the Python standard library. Supports creating environments (interactive and quick create) and finding existing environments. |
| ms-python.python:system | System Installed Python | Global Python installs on your system, typically installed with your OS, from [python.org](https://www.python.org/), or any other OS package manager. |
| ms-python.python:conda  | `conda`                 | The [conda](https://conda.org) environment manager, as provided by conda distributions like [Anaconda Distribution](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/) or [conda-forge](https://conda-forge.org/download/). Supports creating environments (interactive and quick create) and finding existing environments. |
| ms-python.python:pyenv  | `pyenv`                 | The [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) environment manager, used to manage multiple Python versions. Supports finding existing environments. |
| ms-python.python:poetry | `poetry`                | The [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) environment manager, used for dependency management and packaging in Python projects. Supports finding existing environments. |
| ms-python.python:pipenv | `pipenv`                | The [pipenv](https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/) environment manager, used for managing Python dependencies and environments. Only supports finding existing environments. |

#### Supported Actions by Environment Manager

| Environment Manager | Find Environments | Create | Quick Create |
|---------------------|-------------------|--------|--------------|

**Legend:**
- **Create**: Ability to create new environments interactively.
- **Quick Create**: Ability to create environments with minimal user input.
- **Find Environments**: Ability to discover and list existing environments.

Environment managers are responsible for specifying which package manager will be used by default to install and manage Python packages within the environment (`venv` uses `pip` by default). This ensures that packages are managed consistently according to the preferred tools and settings of the chosen environment manager.

### Package Management

The extension also provides an interface to install and uninstall Python packages, and provides APIs for extension developers to contribute package managers of their choice.

The extension uses `pip` as the default package manager, but you can use the package manager of your choice using the `python-envs.defaultPackageManager` setting. The following are package managers supported out of the box:

| Id                     | Name    | Description                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| ---------------------- | ------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ms-python.python:pip   | `pip`   | Pip acts as the default package manager and it's typically built-in to Python.                                                                                                                            |
| ms-python.python:conda | `conda` | The [conda](https://conda.org) package manager, as provided by conda distributions like [Anaconda Distribution](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/) or [conda-forge](https://conda-forge.org/download/). |

#### Default Package Manager by Environment Manager

| Environment Manager | Default Package Manager |
|---------------------|------------------------|
| venv                | pip                    |
| conda               | conda                  |
| pyenv               | pip                    |
| poetry              | poetry                 |
| system              | pip                    |
| pipenv              | pip                    |

### Project Management

A "Python Project" is any file or folder that contains runnable Python code and needs its own environment. With the Python Environments extension, you can add files and folders as projects in your workspace and assign individual environments to them allowing you to run various projects more seamlessly.

Projects can be added via the Python Environments pane or in the File Explorer by right-clicking on the folder/file and selecting the "Add as Python Project" menu item.

There are a few ways to add a Python Project from the Python Environments panel:

| Name         | Description                                                            |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Add Existing | Allows you to add an existing folder from the file explorer.           |
| Auto find    | Searches for folders that contain `pyproject.toml` or `setup.py` files |
| Create New   | Creates a new project from a template. | 

#### Create New Project from Template 
The **Python Envs: Create New Project from Template** command simplifies the process of starting a new Python project by scaffolding it for you. Whether in a new workspace or an existing one, this command configures the environment and boilerplate file structure, so you don’t have to worry about the initial setup, and only the code you want to write. There are currently two project types supported:

- Package: A structured Python package with files like `__init__.py` and setup configurations.
- Script: A simple project for standalone Python scripts, ideal for quick tasks or just to get you started.

## Command Reference

All commands can be accessed via the Command Palette (`ctrl/cmd + Shift + P`):

Utilizing Shell Startup requires changes to the shell script file and is only enabled for the following shells: zsh, fsh, pwsh, bash, cmd. When set to `command`, any shell can be activated. This setting applies only when terminals are created, so you will need to restart your terminals for it to take effect. To revert changes made during shellStartup, run `Python Envs: Revert Shell Startup Script Changes`. |

## Extensibility

The Python Environments extension was built to provide a cohesive and user friendly experience with `venv` as the default. However, the extension is built with extensibility in mind so that any environment manager could build an extension using the supported APIs to plug-in and provide a seamless and incorporated experience for their users in VS Code.

### API Reference (proposed)

See [api.ts](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-python-environments/blob/main/src/api.ts) for the full list of Extension APIs.

To consume these APIs you can look at the example here: [API Consumption Examples](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-python-environments/blob/main/examples/README.md)

### Callable Commands

The extension provides a set of callable commands that can be used to interact with the environment and package managers. These commands can be invoked from other extensions or from the command palette.

#### `python-envs.createAny`

Create a new environment using any of the available environment managers. This command will prompt the user to select the environment manager to use. Following options are available on this command:

```typescript
{
    /**
     * Default `false`. If `true` the creation provider should show back button when showing QuickPick or QuickInput.
     */
    showBackButton?: boolean;

    /**
     * Default `true`. If `true`, the environment after creation will be selected.
     */
    selectEnvironment?: boolean;

    /**
     * Provides some context about quick create based on user input.
     *   - if true, the environment should be created without any user input or prompts.
     *   - if false, the environment creation can show user input or prompts.
     *     This also means user explicitly skipped the quick create option.
     *   - if undefined, the environment creation can show user input or prompts.
     *     You can show quick create option to the user if you support it.
     */
    quickCreate?: boolean;
    /**
     * Packages to install in addition to the automatically picked packages as a part of creating environment.
     */
    additionalPackages?: string[];
}
```

usage: `await vscode.commands.executeCommand('python-envs.createAny', options);`

# Experimental Features

## Shell Startup Activation

The Python Environments extension supports shell startup activation for environments. This feature allows you to automatically activate a Python environment when you open a terminal in VS Code. The activation is done by modifying the shell's startup script, which is supported for the following shells:

-   **Bash**: `~/.bashrc`
-   **Zsh**: `~/.zshrc`
-   **Fish**: `~/.config/fish/config.fish`
-   **PowerShell**:
    -   (Mac/Linux):`~/.config/powershell/profile.ps1`
    -   (Windows): `~\Documents\PowerShell\Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1`
-   **CMD**: `~/.cmdrc/cmd_startup.bat`

If at any time you would like to revert the changes made to the shell's script, you can do so by running `Python Envs: Revert Shell Startup Script Changes` via the Command Palette.

### CMD

1. Add or update `HKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Command Processor` `AutoRun` string value to use a command script.
2. A command script is added to `%USERPROFILE%\.cmdrc\cmd_startup.bat`
3. A script named `vscode-python.bat` is added to `%USERPROFILE%\.cmdrc` and called from `cmd_startup.bat`

contents of `cmd_startup.bat`

```bat
:: >>> vscode python
if "%TERM_PROGRAM%"=="vscode" (
    if not defined VSCODE_PYTHON_AUTOACTIVATE_GUARD (
        set "VSCODE_PYTHON_AUTOACTIVATE_GUARD=1"
        if exist "%USERPROFILE%\.cmdrc\vscode-python.bat" call "%USERPROFILE%\.cmdrc\vscode-python.bat"
    )
)

if defined VSCODE_CMD_ACTIVATE (
    call %VSCODE_CMD_ACTIVATE%
)
:: <<< vscode python
```

### Powershell/pwsh

1. Runs `powershell  -Command $profile` to get the profile location
2. If it does not exist creates it.
3. Adds following code to the shell profile script:

```powershell
#region vscode python
if ($null -ne $env:VSCODE_PWSH_ACTIVATE) {
    Invoke-Expression $env:VSCODE_PWSH_ACTIVATE
}
#endregion vscode python

```

### sh/bash/gitbash

1. Adds or creates `~/.bashrc`
2. Updates it with following code:

```bash
# >>> vscode python
# version: 0.1.0
if [ -n "$VSCODE_BASH_ACTIVATE" ] && [ "$TERM_PROGRAM" = "vscode" ]; then
    eval "$VSCODE_BASH_ACTIVATE" || true
fi
# <<< vscode python
```

### zsh

1. Adds or creates `~/.zshrc`
2. Updates it with following code:

```zsh
# >>> vscode python
# version: 0.1.0
if [ -n "$VSCODE_BASH_ACTIVATE" ] && [ "$TERM_PROGRAM" = "vscode" ]; then
    eval "$VSCODE_BASH_ACTIVATE" || true
fi
# <<< vscode python
```

### fish

1. Adds or creates `~/.config/fish/config.fish`
2. Updates it with following code:

```fish
# >>> vscode python
# version: 0.1.0

    eval $VSCODE_FISH_ACTIVATE
end
# <<< vscode python
```

## Extension Dependency

This section provides an overview of how the Python extension interacts with the Python Environments extension and other tool-specific extensions. The Python Environments extension allows users to create, manage, and remove Python environments and packages. It also provides an API that other extensions can use to support environment management or consume it for running Python tools or projects.

Tools that may rely on these APIs in their own extensions include:

-   **Debuggers** (e.g., `debugpy`)
-   **Linters** (e.g., Pylint, Flake8, Mypy)
-   **Formatters** (e.g., Black, autopep8)
-   **Language Server extensions** (e.g., Pylance, Jedi)
-   **Environment and Package Manager extensions** (e.g., Pixi, Conda, Hatch)

### API Dependency

The relationship between these extensions can be represented as follows:

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microsoft/vscode-python-environments/refs/heads/main/images/extension_relationships.png" width=734 height=413>

Users who do not need to execute code or work in **Virtual Workspaces** can use the Python extension to access language features like hover, completion, and go-to definition. However, executing code (e.g., running a debugger, linter, or formatter), creating/modifying environments, or managing packages requires the Python Environments extension to enable these functionalities.

### Trust Relationship Between Python and Python Environments Extensions

VS Code supports trust management, allowing extensions to function in either **trusted** or **untrusted** scenarios. Code execution and tools that can modify the user’s environment are typically unavailable in untrusted scenarios.

The relationship is illustrated below:

In **trusted mode**, the Python Environments extension supports tasks like managing environments, installing/removing packages, and running tools. In **untrusted mode**, functionality is limited to language features, ensuring a secure and restricted environment.
