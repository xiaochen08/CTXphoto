Codex is OpenAI’s coding agent that helps you write, review, and ship code faster. Use it side-by-side in your IDE or delegate larger tasks to the cloud.

## Pair with Codex

Add Codex as a panel in VS Code to chat, edit, and preview changes seamlessly. With context from opened files and selected code, you can write shorter prompts and get faster, more relevant results. (Tip: many users like moving the Codex panel to the right side of the editor.)

## Delegate to Codex in the cloud

Offload bigger jobs to Codex in the cloud, then track progress and review results without leaving your IDE. For finishing touches, open cloud tasks locally. Codex keeps the context consistent.

## Sign in with your ChatGPT account

Codex works with Plus, Pro, Business, Edu, and Enterprise ChatGPT plans. Learn what’s included in your plan at the [Help Center](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/11369540).
